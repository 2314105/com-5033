# Red-Team Project

## 📌 Overview
Red-Team is a React Native project built with Expo, designed to provide an interactive experience using navigation and UI components. It utilizes `expo-router` for seamless navigation and various Expo modules for extended functionality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (LTS recommended) – [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo CLI** – Install globally via:
  ```sh
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- **Git** (for version control)

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
To get a local copy of the project, run:
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd red-team
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Run the following command inside the `red-team` directory to install all required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### 4️⃣ Start the Project
Launch the development server with:
